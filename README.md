# MBTA Improvements

Let's revisit the [MBTA homework](https://github.com/ga-wdi-boston/wdi_7_js_lab_mbta) with our added knowledge of objects, namespacing, and testing. I've set up the Jasmine files and directory structure for you, but I haven't created any source files or specs.

## Objectives

* Copy in your code from the original MBTA homework, and refactor it to be free of browser-based input and output (there should be no `prompt` or `console.log` anywhere!)
* Encapsulate your code within one or more classes, so that there are no global variables defined anywhere except for the classes themselves
* Write Jasmine tests for all of the functions in your classes, including the initializers if you have any

Remember to make small incremental commits with descriptive messages, and submit a PR when finished.
